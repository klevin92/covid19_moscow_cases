### Welcome to Moscow COVID-19 cases

This repo contains visualisation script for Moscow cases of COVID-19.   
I use only official data from mos.ru and https://t.me/COVID2019_official.   
Unfortunattelly there is no way to parse or collect this data automatically.   
I'm going to update this repo as soon as new data will appear.

Please keep in mind that I'm not a python developer.
If you have reasonable critique please open PR.
For feedback please use issues.
